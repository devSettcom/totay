              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are three primary reasons as to why I am blogging my development journey</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first is to hold myself accountable.  You hear numerous stories of other developers abandonning their projects and I don't want to have the same experience.  If I start blogging, then I will feel an obligation to continue development and finish what I have started.  The people reading and expecting updates from me is what will keep me motivated while I try to create a product that will be cherished by all.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The second is to be transparent with my fanbase. These blogs are meant for the fans to see where on the development cycle my projects are in. I believe that if you are supporting me and my endeavors, you have the right to be up to date as to what is going.  You're reason to support me will always be clear</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The third is to document my progress as a developer. It would be cool to look back at all my blogs some times later down the road and see where I started and where I ended up.</p>
