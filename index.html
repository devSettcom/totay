          <h1>Platformer RPG</h1>
            <p>I am a gamer through and through. Particularly, I am fascinated by strategy and role playing games. As such, with my interest in programming, I decided to embark on creating a video game of my own.  I want to create a role playing game that is able to convey a compelling story for the audience to enjoy.  I am planning on having the game to be played like a platformer, but yet still have RPG elements incorporated to hopefully create a fun and fulfilling experience for all. The logistics and everything are still being planned, but the game engine of choice for  this project will be Godot. </p>

          <h1>Programming Mentor</h1>
<p>After graduating in 2018, I have decided to return to the robotics team I helped build from the ground up and support them further as a mentor. I am ready to utilize the knowledge I gained from computer science class at UCSD to help the Clairemonsters win their robotics competition.</p>

          <h1>Robotics</h1>
              <p>I not only helped established my high school's robotics team but also had the role of lead programmer for four years. My task was to teach new team members the ins and outs of programming the robot in JAVA. I also had to lead the programming team and direct the direction of the code towards the goal of the competition.  Throughout the four years I have been involved with robotics, I have programmed robots to do various tasks, such as moving the robot in omnidirections, lifting and lowering objects, and climbing a wall.  </p>

          <h1>I Do Blogs</h1>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are three primary reasons as to why I am blogging my development journey</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first is to hold myself accountable.  You hear numerous stories of other developers abandonning their projects and I don't want to have the same experience.  If I start blogging, then I will feel an obligation to continue development and finish what I have started.  The people reading and expecting updates from me is what will keep me motivated while I try to create a product that will be cherished by all.</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The second is to be transparent with my fanbase. These blogs are meant for the fans to see where on the development cycle my projects are in. I believe that if you are supporting me and my endeavors, you have the right to be up to date as to what is going.  You're reason to support me will always be clear</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The third is to document my progress as a developer. It would be cool to look back at all my blogs some times later down the road and see where I started and where I ended up.</p>
