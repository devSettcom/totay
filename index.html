                <h2>Robotics</h2>
                <p>I not only helped established my high school's robotics team but also had the role of lead programmer for four years.
                    My task was to teach new team members the ins and outs of programming the robot in JAVA.
                    I also had to lead the programming team and direct the direction of the code towards the goal of the competition.
                    Throughout the four years I have been involved with robotics, I have programmed robots to do various tasks, such as moving
                    the robot in omnidirections, lifting and lowering objects, and climbing a wall.</p>

                <h2>Developing Role Playing Platfromer Game</h2>
                <p>I am a gamer through and through. Particularly, I am fascinated by strategy and role playing games. As such, with my interest in programming, I decided to embark on creating a video game of my own. I want to create a role playing game that is able to convey a compelling story for the audience to enjoy. I am planning on having the game to be played like a platformer, but yet still have RPG elements incorporated to hopefully create a fun and fulfilling experience for all. The logistics and everything are still being planned, but the game engine of choice for this project will be Godot.</p>
