          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Ever since I received my first Gameboy, I have always been fascinated with computer science.  I am interested in learning how the technology I utilize everyday work and function. Eventually, I want to have a career in computer science and be able to create technologies that other people will love and employ everyday. To advance this interest further, I have participated in our schoolâ€™s robotics team and self-taught myself in various other languages, such as C# and HTML.</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was really passionate about computer science entering high school so I became one of the founding members of the robotics club back in my freshmen year. I had the most passion for programming so I took the helm and lead the programming department of the team. The club ran its program through the FIRST Robotics organization to which we had mentors to aid us with our robots.  The mentors in the club had taught me a lot about the engineering and computer science.  For example, I learned about the coding language of JAVA, electrical circuits, soldering, motor mechanics,  and architectural design.  I even became proficient enough in JAVA that I am tasked with teaching upcoming programmers about the language and the robotics framework that FIRST provides.  By founding and participating in the robotics club, I my knowledge about computer science expanded tremendously and I became that much close to my goal. </p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;My passion for computer science did not stop at the robotics club as I started to self-teach myself other coding languages.  I taught myself C# by dabbling in the Unity Game Engine and created various test games as a hobby. In addition, I also taught myself HTML through watching YouTube videos, studying at Codecademy, and writing test websites in order to acclimate to the language. The intrinsic motivation that I displayed by learning HTML even landed me an internship at my school to moderate their website. </p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am a person with great ambitions and motivation to study and succeed in computer science. </p>
